# Stock-Price-Predictor
## A machine learning model for predicting Microsoft stock price

I built this application over the summer to further my understanding of machine learning and improve my confidence with handling larger sets of data. I chose this project since the interaction between finance and technology interests me.

### Initial Objectives
1. To find unorthodox correlations between the Microsoft and other stocks
2. Use a machine learning model to process the price data from these correlated stocks
3. Handle, clean and process the large number of values involved with stock price data

### Outcomes
1. Produced a model which predicted the binary change in the Microsoft stock with 68.4% accuracy
2. Implemented a successful machine learning model through the use of random forest classification
3. Represented findings through the use of matplotlib while also furthering my understanding of pandas, numpy and scikit-learn

### Moving Forward
1. To follow up I want to learn more about alternative machine learning models
2. Improve the accuracy of the model through leveraging different types of data
3. Implement further testing through the use of finance APIs
